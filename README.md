# openlr-js
OpenLR implementation in JavaScript

Java binaries and the OpenLR specification can be found at [OpenLR.org](http://www.openlr.org/)

Currently only supports **line** encoding and decoding.
This project is open to contributions, and will likely support more OpenLR geometries in the future.
